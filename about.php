						Food O' Cycle started off with the simple idea of reducing waste,
						while trying to reduce community hunger at the same time. 

                        Our mission is to help others who are in need by not letting food go to waste. We want to bring 
                        people together and work as a community to support an important cause.

                        We offer the ability for companies that have extra food that they will not be utilizing, to donate 
                        it instead of throwing it out. This has been designed so that food banks can easily and efficiently 
                        find what they are in need of as well as make it quick and efficient for companies to donate the food. 

                        One of the founders of this company, Fred McGallahan, was a waiter at one of his local restaurants in an 
                        area of poverty. He saw first hand the amount of food that was being wasted on a daily basis as well 
                        as the amount of people in the area in desperate need of food. Wishing he could do more to help the 
                        community he grew up in, he came up with the idea to take food that was going to be thrown out by the 
                        restaurant to local shelters and food banks. Seeing how much that helped the shelters and food banks, 
                        he assumed that most other restaurants were doing the same with unused food and went around to gather 
                        the food from local restaurants. Every week, he was making deliveries to shelters and food banks. The word 
                        was spreading quickly about what Fred was doing and other people in the community wanted to help. 
                        Other cities heard about what was happening and started doing the same thing. Once Fred realized how 
                        much, not only his community, but communities all of the country needed this service, he helped establish 
                        a team together that would be able to create the service online to make it more convenient for everyone 
                        involved. 
                        
                        To do so, our team had to come up with a way of connecting businesses that could donate, and 
                        the organizations that could accept these donations and this is the result!

                        We hope you enjoy!
